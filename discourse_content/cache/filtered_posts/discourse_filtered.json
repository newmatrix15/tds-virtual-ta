You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.

When I logged in today it says score is 0. Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again? Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links? If [seek] (Nptel Seekh) can access [TDS exam] (Technical Assessment) then why we need to submit from seek?",
    "answer": "The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. .anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regards",

    "answer": "You would have to be a bit more specific on what exactly is the nature of your error on your machine. GA2 - Q6 has no dependency on the OS or your computer. It uses Github (an online platform), it uses Vercel (an online platform) and thats it. I have a macbook air and it works fine for GA2 - Q6. Since the code you are running has no such dependency on your local machine it should not have problems. Now typical problems for example Q6 (and other questions) might involve the use of CORS. So for example the url might work in your browser when you access the vercel deployment url directly, but when using it via the GA, the request triggers a CORS error, because a third party application is requesting rather than you directly. Also the live sessions on youtube will address some of these deployment related issues that students are facing. There will be session 2025-01-20T14:30:00Z→2025-01-20T16:30:00Z which will be recorded that will address any concerns on how to use these technologies and libraries.

    "answer": "Typically for a vercel application, and in particular for GA2-Q6, the applications are basically function calls. You are not expected to setup and run a local http server as you are doing in your code. When a call is made to the endpoint which in this scenario is /api with parameters, only one function is required, i.e the function that handles the get request. The rest is also automagically handled by vercel. There might be a conflict between vercel’s webserver deployment and the one you explicitly have encoded in your program. That’s why if you see in the course content about vercel, the simplest API service that you can launch with vercel looks something like this # api/index.py import json from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler): def do_GET(self): self.send_response(200) self.send_header('Content-type','application/json') self.send_header( Access-Control-Allow-Origin , * ) self.end_headers() self.wfile.write(json.dumps({ message : Hello! }).encode('utf-8')) return Notice there is no if __name__ == __main__ : code block. This would instruct the interpreter that this is the starting point of your module. Clearly we do not want that, we want vercel to handle all the backend server stuff because vercel might be running some preflight code before it runs your application. if __name__ == __main__ : is used to execute some code only if the file was run directly, and not imported. In vercel, it might not be the starting point of the application. Try rewriting it with just the required endpoint function inside the default handler class. Avoid custom named classes until you can get a working prototype working using the boilerplate that has been shared. Another possible problem: By default, the JSON module encodes Unicode objects (such as str and Unicode) into the u escape sequence when generating JSON data. The GA however is expecting a serialised UTF-8 JSON response instead. These might look the same on the screen but are not equivalent at the bytecode level. These encoding problems were covered in one of the videos that talked about encoding issues TDS > Development Tools > unicode So converting your output to UTF-8 might fix it. Let us know what worked. We are all learning from each other. Kind regards",

    "answer": "I’m not sure of the exact reason for the issue, but there are different ways to deploy to Vercel. One approach is using a vercel.json configuration file, and another is adding headers directly in the API code. You can follow Gui Bibeau’s guide to add CORS headers to your deployment setup. Also check the recording from yesterday’s session for more clarity in that session Carlton deployed application directly from github repository. If you’re still facing issues, you can join today’s session at 9 PM. For deploying a Flask or FastAPI app to Vercel, refer to this guide on DEV Community. I’ve tried both methods, and they work well.",

    "answer": "Nothing unethical about using codespaces and public ports. You solved it. Thats what TDS is about. Solutions. How you achieved is not very relevant. There is more than one way to skin a cat. That being said, it good to find multiple ways to solve a problem, because a single method may not work everytime. Like for example in an ROE. You have no time and you got to be able to on the fly try different approaches, if one way does not work. Also purely from the point of view of being a “scientist”, its fun to be able to solve the question of how do you get a locally running server available on the web to a client. So in that sense, I understand the “spirit of your question”. Most of the issues that most people face has to do with limited understanding of how applications and networks communicate. These are first and foremost apps that leverage various aspects of network communication. There are entire courses that deal with that subject, we want you to at least understand the basics. In that regard we have not actually provided you sufficient materials to get to grips with that. It is something we ought to address, but then students complain about having to learn too many things. Yet these are basic essentials! So we are trying to get the balance right. For the most part many just muddle their way through it (like most of us I suspect), but some structured understanding of how these communications happen are probably worth their weight in gold for any aspiring data scientist because you then do not have to get IT nannies to deploy something quickly and you will wow your bosses as the guy/gal who just gets it done. In the meanwhile: There are other great videos on the above channel, but these are probably the most relevant for us. Modern applications also leverage the same concept by using ports to talk to each other and provide services. These then have to be made visible to the outside world using some routing tables, but there are software that does this automagically. But sometimes when things break, understanding why its not working will go a long way towards helping you find the solution. And a fix might be as simple as an entry on a firewall or on a routing table (a one line CLI fix). And everyone thinks you are a genius, when in actual fact you just know a little bit more about the underlying architecture that glues everything.

I have to redo the entire process for it to be correct again. Can you clarify why this is happening?",
    "answer": "because it dynamically checks the answer each time a submit is done and if the ngrok tunnel and the service is not running at the time, then it marks it wrong. Since every student’s answer is going to be unique (unlike a mathematics question), by necessity we have to dynamically check the answer each submit. The workaround to prevent having to do it all over again, is to simply check all your answers that do not need active running servers first, then before doing a final save, run the servers for the required questions and the ngrok tunnel and submit to get the full marks. Just dont forget that your last save is what gets graded. Just ignore for now once you got it working. Solve all the other ones first and then for the final submission “get all your ducks in a row.” Kind regards",

Also, test with http://localhost:8000/api to see if it works. If that doesn’t solve the problem and you’re running port 8000 inside a virtual machine, use the ipconfig command to check the correct IP address.

    "question": "Hi sakshi in vercel problem i also had similar error. remove this code if name == ‘main’: 24 # app.run(debug=True) frm your flask app then run it. it worked for me i found this with the help of chatgpt. vercel has some built in features to run so this is not required it seems.",
    "answer": "Hi Srividya, Thats right the idea behind vercel is you do not need to create a server. Its serverless! Instead you create functions that respond to endpoints. When the endpoint is triggered, the appropriate function runs. This renders name == main part of the code unnecessary at best, since python interpreters only run this line if that file was the starting point of the application (but its not, because a vercel wrapper application(s) or processes have started before it). In other words you do not create a flask server, or a http server or indeed any server at all. Just functions tied to specific endpoints. So you have to rethink how your application is designed. You do not create serverless applications in the same traditional way you have been taught in MAD-1 or MAD-2. This is a common mistake many students have been making with their approach to vercel. Watching the videos and using the provided code template will greatly help in deploying successful serverless applications. Thanks for your input. Kind regards",

    "answer": "Hi For Question 10, ensure that all servers are running every time you submit (click the Save button). Since ngrok generates a new URL each time it runs, double-check that the ngrok URL is correct before submitting. For Question 9, did you enable CORS? To verify, check your browser console—if CORS is not enabled, you should see an error message indicating the issue. For question 5, I have tried executed script with your set of parameters, your answer is correct. Will discuss it internally. Kind regards.

Your application should be able to take parse the input and be able to run commands that do similar things in parameterised fashion.

Very methodical, well structured, logical and even incorporates (unnecessarily) two different ways of evaluating its performance via local llm or the project proxy. I just want to forewarn you (and others who are tempted to just blindly copy and paste) that evaluate.py is not meant to give you an exact expectation of what prompts will be sent to your application. In other words getting 10/10 in evaluate.py does NOT guarantee 10/10 or even 5/10 or 1/10 in the real evaluation. So do not write your code so rigidly that it will only work in the very strict interpretation of evaluate.py. It has always been meant to give you a feel for what to aim for. Your code should be flexible enough to deal with the general idea of the task. That said, evaluate.py is a good way to know what to expect. Some of Phase A tasks although given a detailed specification in the project description, will still be given challenging prompts (i.e. hard difficulty, and requires some clever self correcting mechanism). Some of the tasks will be given straight forward prompt (i.e. easy for your application). Some of the tasks will be given with some level of parameterisation that deviates from the strict interpretation (i.e. medium difficulty). Hope that helps with how you deal with Phase B tasks (and making your Phase A more robust to a stronger evaluation.) A word of caution: (i.e. this is just some advice, not a set in stone recommendation) Your requirements.txt is massive. If your code does not execute a task (possibly your first task) within 20 seconds (on our server) then it will fail that task. You might want to consider a dynamic, flexible way of installing only required libraries when necessary and keeping the image footprint small and efficient, as we will necessarily have limits on how big we allow images to grow since we have to run and evaluate hundreds of images automatically.

    "question": ".anand I am getting below error message from LLM end points https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions or https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/v1/embeddings , while running my project . Kindly help me to resolve this issue. [Image OCR] {‘error': API Error: 429, { “message”: On 2025-02 you used $2.002295600000011, exceeding $2 } } ",
    "answer": "Hi Telvin You have run out of tokens. Thats what the message is saying. You ran out 3 days ago. It was clearly mentioned that the limit is $1. You have exceeded $2. In our current internal build of project 1, we have yet to exceed $0.50 As to whether it can be renewed is something we have still not yet decided, because the question you have raised equally would apply to everyone. Raising it for you means raising it for everyone. $1 for everyone equals raising it by $1600+ (i.e Rs 1.39 Lakhs) for us! The budget question then involves more than one person. It also involves the BS Team Operations and not just the TDS team and therefore instead of responding with a response that is not useful, we typically try to solve the problem first and then respond. In short we are working on it. But as we have mentioned repeatedly in our sessions, use APIs efficiently, thats part of the skill. As soon as we have a resolution we will inform everyone via an announcement and an email.

The thing is GPT-4o-mini is intelligent enough to understand what kind of task you are asking it do, and extracting Credit Card info from an image is one of the many prohibited tasks. What you can do is, try to fool it using itself. Just ask ChatGPT to generate a prompt that would be capable of fooling itself into extracting out that credit card info.

    "question": "I don’t think the project is too difficult to implement—it’s essentially a simple HTTP API for an AI agent that reads a task, converts it into parameters, and passes those parameters to specific functions to complete the task. However, the instructions in the project question aren’t very clear. Before the session, I am unable to fully understand the question. It took me almost an entire day just to understand what we need to do. Sir Could you provide test cases or a sample answer for Phase B?",

    "answer": "Actually, some IMDb titles have multiple names. For example, The Recruit is also known as Graymail in India. My server checks from a different region from yours. Hence the need for manual corrections for a few titles. Why didn’t I pick an exercise that could be fully automated? Because this is how real-life data sourcing is. It’s never perfect. You often need to create workflows where you’re able to quickly correct such errors in automation.",

    "question": "sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .",
    "answer": "Hi Hari, The goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended. Have you watched this session in particular? If thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it followed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases But of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student. Ultimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.

Many of the client companies have archives of receipts from past years, which have been digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. However, due to the condition of some receipts (e.g., torn, faded, or partially damaged), the OCR process sometimes produces incomplete JSON data. These imperfections can lead to truncated fields or missing values, which complicates the process of data aggregation and analysis. One of ReceiptRevive's major clients, RetailFlow Inc., operates numerous brick-and-mortar stores and has an extensive archive of old receipts. RetailFlow Inc. needs to recover total sales information from a subset of these digitized receipts to analyze historical sales performance. The provided JSON data contains 100 rows, with each row representing a sales entry. Each entry is expected to include four keys: city: The city where the sale was made. © product: The product that was sold. ¢ sales: The number of units sold (or sales revenue). id: A unique identifier for the receipt. Due to damage to some receipts during the digitization process, the JSON entries are truncated at the end, and the id field is missing. Despite this, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily interested in the aggregate sales value. Your Task As a data recovery analyst at ReceiptRevive Analytics, your task is to develop a program that will: 1. Parse the Sales Data: Read the provided JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data. Despite the truncated data (specifically the missing id), you must accurately extract the sales figures from each row. 2. Data Validation and Cleanup: Ensure that the data is properly handled even if some fields are incomplete. Since the id is missing for some entries, your focus will be solely on the sales values. 3. Calculate Total Sales: Sum the sales values across all 100 rows to provide a single aggregate figure that represents the total sales recorded. By successfully recovering and aggregating the sales data, ReceiptRevive Analytics will enable RetailFlow Inc. to: * Reconstruct Historical Sales Data: Gain insights into past sales performance even when original receipts are damaged. ¢ Inform Business Decisions: Use the recovered data to understand sales trends, adjust inventory, and plan future promotions. « Enhance Data Recovery Processes: Improve methods for handling imperfect OCR data, reducing future data loss and increasing data accuracy. ° Build Client Trust: Demonstrate the ability to extract valuable insights from challenging datasets, thereby reinforcing client confidence in ReceiptRevive's services.

MY q8 is : Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2025-01-09T12:36:14.085Z with at least 1 comment with 4 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id , and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order. when i use below query, i get some some result, a table of post_id but error : Error: At root: Array length mismatch Reason: below query checking only 1st comment ($[0] refers to the first comment in the array) we have to check all comments not 1st. But when i change the query to check any one comment its giving different types of error.

May be my query is wrong or may be not. Thankyou",
    "answer": "Your query construction is unnecessarily complicated and therefore will be difficult to debug. Query construction is best done by thinking what you want at the end. In this case its an ordered post_id So thats where you begin: SELECT post_id FROM ( ... ) ORDER BY post_id Doing this, produces the actual result without giving the logic yet. Then at each stage you add the next stage of complexity. You will still need the post_id for the outermost layer so you have to continue extracting it from the inner layers of the nested query. ... ... FROM ( SELECT post_id, ( ... ) as max_stars FROM social_media WHERE time_stamp >= (whatever the parameter you have been given) AND max_stars >= (whatever the parameter for min stars you have been given) ) ... ... Then the final layer of the nest ... ... ( ) as max_stars ... ... You are not expecting me to solve the whole question right? (Hint: the inner most extraction involves JSON or “structure” extraction, which is a powerful capability) But I hope you understand the logic of SQL which is a very elegant set theory language which is why it has lasted for over 4 decades. Think clearly at each stage what do you need. Start with the answer and work backwards, extracting at each stage the logical items you require for the outer layer to be functional. Kind regards",

Sir please look into it we have given so many days to complete this project. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you Satvik Sawhney 23f2003680",
    "answer": "So the reason for the failure is: You had initially put your Dockerfile inside a directory called TDSP-1-main instead of being directly in your repo. (On 15th Feb 1:26AM) Then when our automated script checked if students repos met the requirements and yours did not we immediately sent out a warning email as a opportunity for students to make the necessary corrections. Then once you realised your mistake, on Feb 17th at 9:11 pm IST i.e yesteday, you changed your repo to put the files in the correct locations. Then you finally posted here on Discourse with the image [quote=“21f3002647, post:1, topic:167471”] [/quote] showing that your files are in the correct place. We do not take into consideration modifications to your repo after the deadline because then we would have to extend that curtesy to all students. Kind regards [Image OCR] a.

    "question": "Thanks for the answer Is it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ? P.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.",
    "answer": "The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time). If your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann” So practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard. There will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test. Kind regards",

    "question": "Is there scope for collaboration in a 45 minute test?",
    "answer": "Depends on the collaborators and how they split up the tasks. If its a team that knows their roles and a team leader that can designate tasks correctly then quite possibly. In practise though that rarely happens. Also 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE. Each one is unique. There have been ROEs as long as 2 hours and on the minimum side 30 mins.",

    "question": "If possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.",
    "answer": "Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3. Project 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase. We generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started. The GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more. We try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs. Hence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system. Hope that give you some insight into how TDS works. Thanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP. Kind regards",

    "question": "dear when will yesterday’s recorded session on mock ROE 1 be uploaded on YouTube?",
    "answer": "We will have it uploaded sometime this morning. It has two parts to it. The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things: The chaos of ROE. The adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools. The limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this). The value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team. The ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly Workflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions The pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well). How limited the time is. The second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE. Past terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us. Today’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit). I would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock. Kind regards",

    "question": "Hello sir , for me given constituency was SRI GOBINDPUR and in the dataset there are multiple names for this constituency i think over the period names were changed of this constituency i have filtered constituencies from punjab using below code in colab df_gobindpur = df[df[ AC ].str.contains( SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR , case=False, na=False)] is this correct approach or i have to consider only SRI GOBINDPUR name only? but then this constituency is not availble after 1957 using above filtering i got below data for SRI GOBINDPUR drive.google.com df_gobindpur.csv Google Drive file. then i used margin formula as margin_percentage = ((winner_votes - runner_up_votes) / total_votes) * 100 using this i got answer for 1st question as YEAR 1992 AC 4 SRIHARGOBINDPUR WINNER 1 GURNAM SINGH WINNER_PARTY CPI WINNER_VOTES 5000.0 RUNNER_UP 2 MUSTAK MASIH RUNNER_UP_PARTY INC RUNNER_UP_VOTES 1115.0 MARGIN_PERCENTAGE 50.599114 which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 pls guide where i might be wrong, thanks",
    "answer": "shubhamatkal: df_gobindpur = df[df[ AC ].str.contains( SRI GOBINDPUR|SRIHARGOBINDPUR|SRI HARGOBINDPUR , case=False, na=False)] For this kind of name difference you can use Openrefine software shubhamatkal: which is 50.60 , but answer is 62.64 That answer is wrong, we will be releasing a script with correct python snippets.

    "question": "Respected Sir, I noticed that my status is still marked as absent. I understand I may be a bit impatient, but I wanted to clarify my submission. I had submitted the ROE on time before 1:45 PM, though I was unaware that submissions were allowed until 1:47 PM. Even after the deadline, I attempted to increase my marks upon learning about the method to unlock the ROE. While I did make changes after the deadline, my initial submission before 1:45 PM had already secured some marks, meaning I was not absent. Additionally, I recall you mentioning in Project 1 that students should focus on the learning experience rather than just the marks when someone said that this term’s project was tougher than the last. Even if my increased marks were obtained after the deadline, they were still achieved by following all the given instructions and on my own terms and also everyone has different questions. If those changes were submitted in the same manner, I am unsure why they are not being considered. I understand it’s my mistake that I was not able to solve the entire ga in time but I had conditions which I had submitted in the feedback google form. Since this is a standalone degree for me, I’m actually worried about it. When I learned how to unlock the ROE, I completed it in a very short time. Please consider the top marks even when did after the normal deadline as marks still got submitted rollnumber 23f2001390",

    "answer": "The key learning objective for Project 2 is for you to be absolutely comfortable interacting with APIs and understanding how they work to perform tasks. So there is very little need for the use of LLMs or agents. Identify the the question being asked (how you do this is upto you, you can be as simplistic as using regex to look for some key words, or you can be clever and create embeddings out of the original question and calculate the similarity from the request) Create a function that solves the question with the required parameters and inputs. Remember this does not have to be fancy. Just compute the answer. You do not need to do the task as the GA required. You ONLY want the answer. No tools required. Just a computed answer. Give the answer back as specified. Kind regards",

I will try to cover most common doubts, so that you wouldn’t need to answer similar doubts again. Sorry if some of the doubts are basic / written incorrectly. FILES The data file sent to the api will always be in the requester’s local machine. When the api server receives the request, the file will be in binary format? Or Sometimes the api server receives the file in byte and some times, it will recieve a link like this : https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/shapes.png This link was take from GA2 Question 2 HTML AND TABLE Some questions have html and tables. In this case will these two be in a file encoded in binary, or will it be a string. Example for string. Consider the table Col 1 Col 2 Row 1, Col1 Row 1 Col 2 Row 2, Col 1 Row 2 Col 2 Will this be something like this |Col 1| Col 2| |-|-| |Row 1, Col1 | Row 1 Col 2| |Row 2, Col 1|Row 2 Col 2| or something like <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Col 1</th> <th>Col 2</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Row 1, Col1</td> <td>Row 1 Col 2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Row 2, Col 1</td> <td>Row 2 Col 2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> HIDDEN BLOCK AND ANSWER : 2 TASKS In one question, there were two tasks.

Should it just be the answer or should it be the html string which will have the disabled block enabled and also the answer string sitting inside the block MORE THAN ONE FILE Some questions have more than one file.

    "question": "Respected TDS Team, I currently have Three doubts regarding Project 2: As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate. mydata939×401 18.3 KB friend data938×465 20.5 KB During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed. In GA4 Q2, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe. Please check the issue in the images provided. How to handle this question. In GA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, sir had mentioned that the question would be revised. Here is the thread link for reference. How should we handle this question now?

    "answer": "lakshaygarg654: As per the 19th March session, it was mentioned that the files would be the same for everyone, and only the parameters in the questions would vary. However, I have noticed that the files can actually be different. To support this, I’m attaching screenshots of the CSV files for GA5 Q1—one is mine, and the other belongs to a batchmate. mydata939×401 18.3 KB friend data938×465 20.5 KB During the session, it was said that uploading files would take time, and the suggested solution was to pre-download the files on the server since they are supposed to be the same. But since the files are not identical for all students, this issue needs to be addressed. The file is just 341kb. it should take less than a second. So you do not have to pre download this file. Only very large ones that are not parameterised you can have a hard copy of. lakshaygarg654: In GA4 Q2, my task is to retrieve movie information from IMDb for all films with a rating between 3 and 5. I am scraping the correct movie names(for example 6th movie in given image), but the portal is accepting them differently. All movie names are provided in English, but the portal seems to be accepting some titles in other languages—Spanish, Dutch, I believe. Questions that require manual intervention will be graded very liberally. In other words those questions will not have as strict a grading criteria as in the GA portal. lakshaygarg654: In GA4 Q10, very few students were able to solve the question using LLMs or Python during the assignment. Most of us ended up solving it manually. At that time, sir had mentioned that the question would be revised. Here is the thread link for reference. How should we handle this question now? Same as above.

    "question": "Questions Requiring Clarification/Manual Intervention for Evaluation (As Discussed in Tuesday’s Session) Respected TDS Team, As per the discussion during the Tuesday session, and following ’s suggestion, I am creating this post to list the questions that may require manual intervention or are facing issues potentially due to portal-side behavior. Kindly verify these points before evaluation. Questions Requiring Manual Intervention / Portal-Side Issue GA3 Q8 Issue: The question doesn’t mention all required queries. Although all mentioned queries were added, the portal seems to check for additional queries not stated, resulting in an incorrect answer flag. GA3 Q9 Issue: This question asks to create an LLM prompt, but upon submission, a pop-up requests the AIPROXY_TOKEN. Clarification needed: How are we supposed to handle token-based inputs for evaluation? GA4 Q2 & Q10 Issue: Previously encountered issues have been resolved. Reference: GA4 Q2 and Q10 resolution Output Formatting (Multiple Questions) Issue: When using plain text, the answer is accepted. However, in JSON format, newline characters ( ) and backslashes are added. Note: As per the project requirement, the output should be in JSON like {“answer”: “result”}. But directly copy-pasting such a result with special characters leads to rejection by the portal. Vercel / Docker Hub / Ngrok Deployment Questions Issue: Some deployment-related questions require a **live-running server, which needs real-time manual deployment using platforms like Vercel or Ngrok. Clarification needed: How is this expected to be evaluated? Deployment-Related Issues (To Be Included in Thursday’s Session) Please include discussion and solutions for the following deployment issues: Platform Capability for GA Tasks Which cloud platform (Azure, DigitalOcean, etc.) can handle all GA tasks reliably? Note: Some platforms have limitations that block certain tasks or token usage. File Upload Example via Platform API Request: Please provide examples for both small and large file uploads using API from a cloud-deployed app. This would help validate deployments for assignment questions involving file input. General Observations on GA1-5 Output Accuracy: Approximately 80% of the questions in GA1-5 return correct output when tested on a local machine. However, about 20% either have portal-side issues or deployment-related problems. Kindly review these points before final evaluation, and let us know if any additional clarification is required from our side.",

    "question": "( ) , is it possible to extend the deadline by 2 days April 1st, since we can use the LLM api a little more and Most people(me atleast) have Their OPPEs and its combined syllabus (and the OPPE 1 did not go well, partly due to my inadequacies) , which has much more to cover, since this project involves more involved coding compared to the last project(ideally project one should have taken not more than a day , still messed it up though xD). Asking for extension for 2 days, if possible. Really need it not even want, like need Summary: Please extend Project 2 deadline by 2 days(April 1st), (actually 1 day extension is April 1st)",
    "answer": "Hi , Unfortunately it’s not possible for us to extend the deadline. Project 2 was released almost a month back, and that can be considered ample amount of time to complete the project. I can understand it must be hard to deal with it along with an upcoming OPPE, but this is what it is. Even if you are not able to cover all the 58 questions, try to cover the majority of them, as the evaluation involves sending just 1-3 questions for evals. All the best for your OPPE and your Project 2",

    "question": "and , Hello.. I am facing issue with zip file extraction function which is in many GA1 questions. e.g., for GA1 Q15, if I use 7-zip to extract files, it shows the correct total size when using Postman for local server. If I use python built-in function, it calculates a different value (which is incorrect). So, I used 7-zip. But I (with help from copilot agent) am not able to make 7-zip work on the vercel deployment. Can we just hard code the answers to GA1 questions, or is there a way to take answer from local server and use it for response in vercel (sorry, it doesn’t even make sense to me, but a lot of things are hard to understand anyway)? Or how do we resolve this 7-zip issue. Python built-in extraction did not work correctly even after hours of trying.. I have another question. Due to lack of time, if I just submit the Project 2, with question/answers to GA1, (and if these all work as expected on vercel), how much approx score can we get if I am not able to do other GAs at all for Project 2. Edit after posting: I can hard code questions and other answers from GA2 upto GA4 (I missed GA5, so don’t have those answers). Thank you.",
    "answer": "Hi You can use the zipfile library to extract and access zip files pretty easily. You can even make it so that you don’t even have to download the sent file either zip/csv/etc, in order to access it. All this will be discussed in Thurday’s [27-03-2025] Live Session. Kindly attend the session if you want a deeper understanding of it.",

    "question": "The GA portal marks it as wrong unless I manually insert new lines. I hope that won’t be an issue, will it?",
    "answer": "Your markdown must have newline characters or spaces wherever necessary. Otherwise we will not be able to check if your answer is correct. Our parser will only work if encodings for the formatting are present in the response. If there are no encodings (invisible or visible) then we will not have the correctly formatted file. Please review module 1 for a better understanding about how text is encoded. Especially invisible characters. The browser is designed for user friendliness. Thats why the characters are invisible when you copy paste string with newlines. But it exists. The programmatic strings show invisible encodings as escaped characters. (Usually) To check if a string has invisible characters, # Multi-line string my_string = Hello World with spaces and some newlines and a tab # Print ASCII values of each character print([ord(c) for c in my_string]) e.g., newline = 10, tab = 9 This is a great way to check what we are receiving when you send us some response, import requests import json # This is just an example server to see what we see. url = https://httpbin.org/post my_multiline_string_answer = This is a multiline string that spans multiple lines with spaces and some newlines and a tab as well. response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { answer : my_multiline_string_answer } # Send the JSON data response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) # Check the response print (response.status_code) print (response.json ()) print (response.text) # Do other checks as necessary... See what happens when I print the result print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Its a proper multiline correctly formatted text! The encodings are invisible just like in the original as well as in your clipboard when you copy paste into the GA. Here is a json example: json_answer = { mary : poppins , age : 42 } stringed_json = json.dumps (json_answer) response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator = { answer : stringed_json } response = requests.post (url, json=response_to_send_to_tds_evaluator) print (json.loads (response.text)['json']['answer']) Look at the response. A perfect json. If you do not want spaces in the response then strip the spaces before you send the stringified response.

    "question": "lakshaygarg654: GA4 - Question 9: Process PDF Files A similar issue occurs in GA4 Question 9, where the task involves processing PDF files. While this works perfectly in the local environment, it leads to a 502 Bad Gateway error on Azure. This is due to the relatively long time required to parse and analyze the PDFs, which again exceeds Azure’s execution time limit. Moreover, pre-processing the PDF files is not an option because the input varies for each user. Therefore, the PDFs must be processed dynamically, which adds to the delay and contributes to the timeout problem. I watched the last session. In that session, regarding the specific PDF question, you mentioned that the PDF is the same for everyone, so it can be preprocessed beforehand. However, I checked and found that the PDF is actually different for each user. So, we need to fetch it from the API endpoint. How should we handle the timeout issue on the deployment platform? I even tried upgrading the plan, but it didn’t help. .anand Also, many questions and doubts were addressed in the last two sessions. I can improve a lot and add the remaining questions, but the constraint is the 31st March deadline. Most students, including myself, will only get time after 30th March due to Viva and OPPE. It would be really helpful if the TDS team could extend the deadline. I believe it would strike a good balance—team made us wait for the Project 1 results, but extending the Project 2 deadline would make up for that for some extent. Its request nothing else.",
    "answer": "Hi , Yes for GA4_Q9 the PDF files are different for everyone, but the workflow is exactly the same. Its a basic tabula read, with no particular need of any preprocessing. So, yeah you have to fetch it from the API request. Unfortunately, we can’t extend Project 2 deadline, it was released on 3rd of March, and we believe ample amount of time was given for it.

I just want to decide whether regex or function-calling would be more appropriate her We will take Q1 in this format, which is just copy pasting from portal``` One of the test cases involves sending a sample piece of meaningless text: au7BK3 33 H 5 lKz6y4n oQmbgoX 0 hNW3JH 68Q1u Write a Python program that uses httpx to send a POST request to OpenAI’s API to analyze the sentiment of this (meaningless) text into GOOD, BAD or NEUTRAL. Specifically: Make sure you pass an Authorization header with dummy API key. Use gpt-4o-mini as the model. The first message must be a system message asking the LLM to analyze the sentiment of the text. Make sure you mention GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL as the categories. The second message must be exactly the text contained above. This test is crucial for DataSentinel Inc. as it validates both the API integration and the correctness of message formatting in a controlled environment. Once verified, the same mechanism will be used to process genuine customer feedback, ensuring that the sentiment analysis module reliably categorizes data as GOOD, BAD, or NEUTRAL. This reliability is essential for maintaining high operational standards and swift response times in real-world applications. Note: This uses a dummy httpx library, not the real one. You can only use: response = httpx.get(url, **kwargs) response = httpx.post(url, json=None, **kwargs) response.raise_for_status() response.json() [quote= 22f3000819, post:173, topic:169029 ] The links to the website are hyperlinks in the questions.

    "question": "I reuesting to all my teachers .anand, , , please reply me. What is this going on? Is it joking? Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? Are we studying in IIT - The top institute of India or in a cheap and lower than third class government schools. It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. I don’t think so that they really made any effort in our course. In project-2 also, we need solutions for all graded assignments and so many students request for solutions but our the great teachers ignores the request and didn’t provide the solutions. I think they provide the projects whatever comes in their dreams during sleeping. In weekly study material, don’t have their notes, even they have a very few videos made by them, they just render to other YouTuber’s Youtube videos and online websites. Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. . I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. But on extending the deadline of project-2 just only for one day, their evaluation will be late. In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. It is our tales it is my right to get solutions for every weekly assignment, but don’t ask them to make efforts. Just pay and do assignments at own risk even you have not understand anything from the copy-pasted material. Just use AI’s or read whatever and wherever you want to read. It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’.",
    "answer": "Dear Shahzada, You joined Discourse almost a year ago Jun 8th, 2023. In all that time you have read 832 posts. And never interacted with anyone on discourse. You finally decided to interact once and that was today and this is your first post (your second if we count that you deleted your first post) The first step to receiving help is communication. If you do not communicate, no one can help you. 23f2002668: What is this going on? Is it joking? I am not sure what your question is. I am not sure what you are referring to. Please be clear in your questions. 23f2002668: Our teachers don’t have enough time to make a separate video for project to explain what to do and how to do? We have made several hours of videos on Project 2 and have demonstrated multiple ways to solve it. However, we are not going to ever create it for you. We do teach you all the core technologies you can leverage to create it yourself. 23f2002668: I already have done two project courses and they taught us, even they made 2 - groups just only for discussions in which one is personal and also made a YouTube playlist especially for project. Not sure which courses you are referring to, but those are standalone courses. Here project is part of the course and is meant to take you roughly a few days to create. We gave students more than one month for Project 1 and the solution for it takes a few hours to create. (which we have shared) 23f2002668: They explained what should be your approach? How to make project? Yes these were explained if you either took part in any live session or watched the recorded video 23f2002668: And here, they took only one session just only for show off. And they organised that single session when too many student requests too many times? I am not sure what you are referring to because several sessions were conducted for Project 2 spanning nearly 2 weeks. 23f2002668: It is the responsibility of our teachers to explain the project, but they are just showing off. Project 2 was explained. I can summarise it in these words: Create a server api that receives a request. The request would be any question from the first 5 GAs. The response has to be a json response as specified in the Project page. Multiple demonstrations were done of this workflow in sessions. 23f2002668: Even they never provided the solutions for assignments also. Is it not our right to get solutions so that we can know where we did mistake? Since this is your first post, you’ve never ever asked for solutions to any assignments. We have never provided solution notebooks for TDS. It defeats the learning process. If you want solutions, there are several options: Ask for help (since you have never posted before, you missed the opportunity to receive it) Collaborate with others (a bigger goal of TDS, because in the real world one man bands almost certainly fail with extremely high probability, barring a few exceptions, human progress is built on collaboration) Join live sessions, where we have provided solutions to almost every assignment question that students have asked (and not asked) Watch the live sessions, we have even created neat Q & A summaries for them on the TDS portal (something which no other subject does at the moment) 23f2002668: They don’t have time to make solutions, they just made an assignment checker which checks the assignments automatically. This is one of the most loved features by our students. No other GA in any other course gives you the option to check your answers in real time and better yet correct them before submitting. The biggest clue for solutions is in this nugget. If you take the opportunity, and enterprise and get some fellow students together, you are actually able to obtain the solution script from the GA page itself. It takes some effort, but that is how learning occurs… with effort. Studies repeatedly show that zero effort results in nearly zero learning. 23f2002668: Are we paid just only for these YouTube videos ? If we can understand everything just only from YouTube then why we are studying from the India’s top Engineering institute - The IIT Madras? I have much more better videos than that are provided on YouTube and created by other YouTubers. If you had better resources available, you have hardly been the paragon of virtue, because we always encourage people to share their learnings. We learn from you, just as you learn from us. If someone makes a better video than us and give it for free, we are happy enough to learn from them. Why should we reinvent a video that is poor quality and force students to watch it when there are better videos? We are not so egoistic to take that approach and worse it does not benefit our students to satisfy our ego. There are a million videos out there on you Tube, how do you find the best one? We curate it. So that you do not have to spend hours finding a good video. But feel free to find better videos. More power to you, but what would be even better? Share with others so that we can build each other up. What are the best videos to learn linear algebra? Probably MIT. Why bother with substandard videos when you can just get the best for free? Its just that watching MIT videos will not give you an undergraduate degree from MIT. And it costs Rs. 2.7 crores, provided you even get a seat in the first place. Here you get a 4 year degree for Rs 3.5 lakhs. So you are paying for that. I absolutely 100% agree with you, if you think you can get a better degree for Rs 3.5 Lakhs then definitely do that. There is no point in wasting time and money on something that is not delivering good value to you. 23f2002668: They only have some points copy pasted from documentations, but they never tried to explain them. Just read, copy and paste in your program. What is it, why it is used for, don’t ask anything. Reading documentation is a skill you have to pick up. Having said that, we have always explained something that students have asked. Just ask anyone who attended the sessions. More significantly, most of the new things we learnt, were self taught. Unless you pick up this lifelong habit, you will struggle in the real world. Now is a good time to start. 23f2002668: Some students request for extending the time limit of [roject-2 just only for one day, but what was their excuse- We won’t be able to extend deadline, if we do, then evaluations will get delayed. That is correct. We do not want to evaluations for Project 2 to be delayed as end term is very close. Is your complaint that you want evaluations to be delayed? Also its not an excuse. Its a fact. Delaying submissions, delays evaluations. Its just basic logic. 23f2002668: I want to ask them, where is the result of Project-1? They have already been sent to all those who passed the prerequisites. Yours did not pass the first time. Luckily for you, our first priority is always to do our best for students. So not being satisfied with the validation script that was run which was stricter, we created a new one that was more forgiving. You should get a 0 based on the stricter criteria, but you passed on our more lenient check and now you will soon be getting a normalised 7/20 score (we have not decided the normalisation yet because its a matter of deciding how lenient to be). 23f2002668: The first date of result declaration was 26-Feb, then their another date was 16-March, but until now on 2-Apr, we do not get our results. It is more than 45 days, what is this going on? Nobody tried to ask with our great teachers. If you had attended the live session you would have seen Anand explain the reason for the delay. And we do not mind when students ask why and we freely tell them why. So I do not understand how you came to this conclusion. 23f2002668: In project-2, we have to continue running our project until they will not evaluate, whether they take more than 1, 2 or more months. Either we have to host online by paying or run our own system for 24x7 unto when, we also don;t know as their result date is also not fixed, it is just a combination of letters and numbers showing on portal. Anand invited students to write the evaluation script in his live session. And since you claim it is so easy you could have written it and gotten full marks. I am not sure why you did not take this easy option. You complained about it, but decided not to create a solution? Also if you watched the sessions, we never asked you to run your server for 2 months or 1 month etc. Its generally a bad idea to make assumptions that have no basis in reality. Project 2 is easy to evaluate. We expect it will take a few days, possibly by this weekend to finish evaluation and push a score. So why you came to the conclusion it would take months, is a mystery, given that you already rightfully explained that its easy to write a script. But validation takes time. We want to make sure there are no bugs and errors and a lot of edges are possible when students are running various deployments. So we want to give them the best chance of actually scoring. Unless you prefer we do a rush job and give them zeros. You would have received a zero in your project 1 had we not caught a few edge cases in our testing regime. You can take a poll and ask fellow students if they prefer your approach. We are always happy to make changes based on feedback. 23f2002668: It is my kind request, our term is going to be completed, but please make some efforts in next term. Thankyou to all my respected ‘The Great Teachers’. I am glad you decided make a kind request, although by all the personal insults and attacks and your ending sign off its clear that neither respect nor kindness is evident in your post. But thank you for your feedback. One final note: Do interact more, its healthy. We make mistakes, and we learn. There are many things we want fix for next term. Its not at all our desire to delay evaluations. The complexity of project 1 evaluations was unexpected. So we do apologise for that. We have done so repeatedly, even in our sessions and in discourse posts. The scripts that we released for everyone, probably showed how challenging it was to get it right so that everyone who could get a score, got a score. And when writing posts or emails or any communication, try to stay on point and professional. We are always happy to learn what we can change and improve. Kind regards, TDS team",

    "answer": "-2003 Evaluations will start before this weekend, with some sampling done possibly even tonight and most evaluation runs tomorrow. Also we will prime the target first by sending a dummy request so it gets “warmed up” because some of you have reported time to respond to first request takes time for the server to spin up. Then once we know its responding, we will send requests for evaluation. Kind regards",

    "question": "Dear and .Anand, I successfully deployed my project on Vercel, and it works perfectly when tested using curl commands. Each task installs its required packages and runs as expected. However, I encountered an issue with Vercel’s free version, which has a 250MB limit. While my project’s size without installed packages is approximately 34MB, the size exceeds the limit once packages like Pandas, NumPy, Pillow, Whisper, and Uvicorn are installed, causing the server to crash. Could you kindly suggest any alternatives or solutions for this issue? I would greatly appreciate your guidance, as I fear all my hard work might go to waste without a resolution.",
    "answer": "The alternative is to use vercel purely as an endpoint service that processes most things without large libraries, and for more heavy duty backend work forwards the request to another system that handles it and sends it back to your vercel function which then relays the answer to the request.",

    "question": ", it would be helpful if you could specify a date — a clear deadline",
    "answer": "We cant specify a clear deadline. If we could we would. At the present time there are roughly 100+ evals left in the pipeline. And we retry them to give students the best chance of getting a score. Sometimes we accomodate some unusual situations that we have been made aware of but all of those interrupt our workflows and so it takes time. Which makes this process a little unpredictable. This is the first term where we have had students deploy solutions that require significant compute resources on our end to evaluate. So there was always going to be hickups. But i think that we have delivered an equally enriching learning experience as a result which is enough to land you an actual job. (Might not be so enriching on your CGPA admittedly, but thats a small price to pay for invaluable skills you hopefully have gained)",

In one of the sessions, you had mentioned the possibility of offering alternate questions as a second chance for students, evaluated at half the original marking scheme (i.e., 2 marks per question).",
    "answer": "We will be sending out emails to both sets. Ones who have to keep it on and ones who can shut it down. If you have not received a shutdown notice, assume that you have to keep it on.

    "question": "Hi sir .anand I need your immediate attention regarding my project-2, as I received zero marks, but my server is running completely fine. Below are the key points that I need you to look into: Server is running and reachable. GET and POST requests tested via Postman and VS Code, both return 200 OK. Tested on my laptop and by 10+ other people – all received correct results. No issues seen in logs or deployment – everything was set up properly. Others in my group got full marks – we worked on the same project. I have no idea what went wrong during the evaluation. I’ve spent weeks working on this project, including sleepless nights. This is my last term – if I fail, I will have to repeat the entire diploma. Please recheck my project thoroughly.

    "question": "*Request to Use Public DNS for Course Tool API Deployment or Use Alternate Endpoint Dear I hope you’re doing well! I’m currently running my server and trying to access the API hosted at: https://sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app/api/ However, I’m encountering the following error: curl: (6) Could not resolve host: sss-production-7a97.up.railway.app After some investigation, I found that the issue is related to DNS resolution. The API becomes accessible when using public DNS services like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1). This suggests that the current deployment environment may be using a restricted or unreliable DNS resolver, which causes access issues on some networks (e.g., Jio). Suggested Fix: To ensure reliable access for all students, could you please consider updating the deployment or testing environment to use a public DNS provider? Recommended options: Google DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4 Cloudflare DNS: 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1 This can typically be configured via Docker settings or the environment’s networking configuration. Alternate Option: If the DNS change isn’t possible at the moment, I kindly request that you evaluate my project using the previously deployed endpoint instead: https://tds-project-2-pnlm.onrender.com/api/ Please note that this endpoint may take 50 to 60 seconds to respond, as it’s hosted on a platform with a cold start delay — but it is fully functional and provides the correct outputs. Both endpoints are currently active and return identical results. Thank you so much for your time and support — I truly appreciate the effort you’re putting into helping us succeed in this course!

    "question": "Hi Jivraj, I would like to draw attention to a specific question regarding the process of creating an HTML file and publishing it to GitHub. I notice that I am not providing a preloaded answer when this question arises. Instead, it creates a new repository and an HTML file, then deploys it on GitHub. Initially, it presents a URL, but I understand that your server checks to verify whether the URL contains valid HTML. This verification process takes time, which can lead to an incorrect response when checking the URL right after deployment. At that moment, the URL might not display the HTML content or be verified by your server, even though eventually, the deployment is successful and the URL is correct.

    "answer": "We have not yet updated the scores for ROE (there are roughly 130 students affected by the previous update). So just wait till it gets pushed by operations (most likely Tuesday). I can assure you that we have the right scores on our server, there is just an issue when “transporting” those scores over to the operations team, which we have now rectified and since scores are batch processed it will happen over night during a server update. Bottom line: wait till Tuesday Both bonus and your actual roe scores will reflect on dashboard by then. If not let us know Kind regards.",

However, if others have marked it differently based on their available information, there is a possibility that our responses may vary — potentially exceeding the permissible variance limit of ±33%. In such a scenario, would this mean we would not be eligible for the bonus? Additionally, it would be really helpful if a uniform approach or standard marking could be communicated for such cases where access is not granted.

    "answer": "we had to rely on docker telling us whether an image was arm or x86. So thats why we just did what docker software told us. If it classified an image as arm then we ran it on arm. If it did not then we ran it on x86. Thats why we need students to look through the logs and identify issues so that we can make sure you get the correct evaluation. If students notify us their image is actually arm based, then we will run it on arm. So dont worry, just inform us of any discrepancy as well as bugs. Our evaluation might not be perfect, there may be bugs. If students can precisely create bug reports then we can take that into consideration when evaluating students as well. The benefit being you might get extra marks because of the bug fix. We have a script that looks at this discourse post each day and tells us who requires a fresh evaluation.

    "answer": "We demoed in the live session the complete process of how to dockerise your project so that it can be run anywhere. Running on your local machine is not a sufficient criteria for passing the evaluation. It is absolutely vital for students to understand deployment. This is a critical skill for anyone who is serious about working in this field. Also just check if yours is an arm based image or x86. Sometimes that makes a difference. For us there is no way to know other than docker software telling us. As it turns out several students had an arm based image but docker did not tell us that. So we will re run those. If yours has been run on the wrong emulation then we will re run. Kind regards",

    "question": ", It was a good project, and I have obtained the log files. Upon reviewing the log files, I realized that they are unable to read the files. I checked my project on GitHub and discovered that I forgot to uncomment the line that defines the path using the os library. As a result, all file evaluations returned errors such as “can’t read the file.” I understand that this oversight was my mistake. However, is there any way to reevaluate the code by simply uncommenting that line? I believe the rest of the code is properly written, but due to this single comment, all the files remained unchecked or resulted in errors.

    "question": "Hi ! I am reaching out with deep frustration and concern regarding the evaluation of my project. I have worked tirelessly on this for almost two weeks, dedicating day and night to ensure that the tasks were executed correctly. During my own testing, I was able to get at least 7 out of 10 A tasks working as expected. However, after the evaluation, I was informed that none of the tasks were executed properly, which was quite shocking! Given the effort and time I have put in, I kindly request you to review my project once more. I am more than willing to demonstrate the functionality in real time to clarify any issues or misunderstandings. Please let me know if there is a possibility to discuss this further, as I genuinely believe my work deserves another review.",

    "question": "then why is the image id different? in the docker hub as well as my local terminal the image id is 07b16dc68225",
    "answer": "When we build it after pulling it, it will get a unique identifier that makes sure we will only ever evaluate exactly that version. We pull it from your submission in the form. In other words, if any changes occur to the docker repo, our id will no longer match a newer version of the file. This way we can make sure we are evaluating the right version every time. Your id does not have to match ours. But we can detect changes made to the docker repo through our image id. I hope that is clear. We will do some extra sanity checks before the 1/4/2025 just incase there are any issues. But thanks for asking the question. Kind regards",

    "answer": "The image id varies depending on the system it was built on. When we build it on our Xeon cloud compute it will get a different image id from yours (unless you have a Xeon system). What is common is the dcoker hub image name and tag we used. We used the one you submitted on your form. But the image id serves the same purpose. If you alter the dockerhub image, our image will no longer match the one from dockerhub. the image id sha will change. So do not worry about whether your sha matches our sha. It just acts as a way for us to make sure that we are consistently looking at the same image. Kind regards",

Extract and save all authors from the first page, in order, to /data/b6.json as an array of strings. E.g. [ Douglas Adams , J.K.

    "question": "I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent. Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded.

    "answer": "We have communicated it in the live sessions. It was also communicated via an email when students failed first prerequisite check pass back in February 16th. At that time we gave students a time window to fix it. We discussed it internally with .anand and he stated that it is standard industry practise to put Dockerfile in the root folder of a github and he expects students to do it regardless of whether we explicitly mentioned it or not on the project 1 page. The reason being, any Docker image being built from a github repo is never going to look for the file sitting inside a directory. All build requirements have to be at root (this is not just for Docker, but also any other type of application build). Since root is where the core files to build an application always reside, again this is standard industry practise. In our meeting we advocated for a lenient approach to search for Dockerfile inside the github and it was vetoed by .anand So unless you can give a convincing argument why we should change our evaluation script and re run it for everyone again, (because that is effectively what we would have to do to make it fair to everyone), we will not be able to evaluate your docker image.

    "question": "Sir, I would like to respectfully ask if this is some sort of April Fool’s joke, as it appears that the TDS team is still only verifying the presence of files in the git repository and checking the accessibility of the repository. I fully understand the importance of marks and the effort we put into Project 1. That’s why I carefully ensured that all the necessary files and links were correctly uploaded yet I received a 0 Score. I am not the only one facing this issue; several others have encountered the same problem. I kindly request you to review my submission again. Additionally, I have faced multiple technical issues in recent times. Initially, I was failed in the L1 viva due to a typing mistake, which was later acknowledged. Similarly, in both OPPE 1 and OPPE 2, many students experienced Google Meet issues. On March 29, during my SC OPPE, I faced camera issues in Google Meet, along with VM lagging. Many students have raised similar concerns with Proctor. Given this track record of technical problems, I strongly believe this could be another error in evaluation. I sincerely request you to re-evaluate my submission.

    "question": "Sir, In the mail that i got about project 1 report. In the log file it was written as TasksA.py file not found in docker, which was the case i observed with many students. This is my Github repo: I built the image using docker build command in vs code terminal. And pushed it same way to dockerhub using docker push command. How is it possible that the docker container missed the TasksA.py file while building or pushing it? After getting this mail, I ran the project locally again mutliple times just to check if there was any issues in the code. It was getting 9/10 test cases passed.

    "question": "I completely understand that changes to the Docker image after the deadline cannot be accepted. However, there are specific cases like mine where the Project 1 submission successfully passed the sanity checks on Feb 15 and received a decent score when the evaluation results were released on Mar 29. But here’s the catch:** Since the problem statement for Project 1 and Project 2 is nearly the same, I took the opportunity to improve upon my Project 1 and use it as the foundation for my Project 2 submission, which I did by:* Implementing a ReAct-based workflow planning & orchestration agent, inspired by the paper ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. Implementing various tools for web-serping, web-scraping, read-eval-print-loops interpreters for quick calculations, etc. Enhancing Shell-use & Python-use by improving upon the existing code interpreter I had implemented for P1. This allowed the agent to dynamically generate and execute code without hardcoding anything. Adding useful API endpoints, including an /api/ multipart/form endpoint, alongside the existing /read and /run endpoints from Project 1, plus a /clear endpoint to reset the agent’s conversation memory if the context window gets saturated. Deploying the entire project on a paid GCP VM Instance with a static IP, utilizing my own OpenAI API key while keeping OpenAI’s API as a fallback in case AIPROXY ever gave up. All this hard work evolved my project into something far beyond a simple Tool-Calling Agent—it essentially became a ReAct Principles based Computer-Using Agent capable of executing complex, non-linear workflows entirely within a container. And I’m not exaggerating: You could ask it to perform something like hyperparameter tuning for a Random Forest Classifier, offloading the results locally on a JSON file and displaying its contents, and it would do that for you—without ever declining the request. I like to think of it as a terminal version of OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent. Given all the effort, time, and money that went into this, it’s incredibly discouraging to see my project naturally fail a sanity check (Docker image digest mismatch) (because of the aforesaid updates) and not get evaluated as a result. This is not the kind of experience that encourages students to learn, experiment, and innovate. To clarify, all the updates mentioned above took place after March 29, after Project 1 had already been evaluated, and results had been handed out. Furthermore, we were never informed that a reevaluation would take place on April 1. Had I known, I would have ensured that my original submission remained unchanged and considered creating a duplicate of my Docker image and implementing all the aforementioned enhancements on it. My only request is that if my updated P1 submission cannot be evaluated due to the changes made after March 29 (before the P1 reevaluation on April 1), I would really appreciate it if my original P1 eval score could be reinstated instead of receiving a 0—since it was already evaluated and graded. Would highly appreciate your prompt support in this regard [Image OCR] available which is nearly 5 times faster than the fastest domestic internet.

    "answer": "Firstly, you have passed evaluation and got a decent score (on a more lenient script that we used for everyone.) The email was sent by a script that used a more stricter evaluation (which understandably caused some stress). So you can breathe a sigh of relief. However with regards to your long post… Let me tell you a true story. I personally know a very experienced senior engineer at a top defense contractor for the US, here is some pearls of wisdom from him. What you have done is what is called in industry as gold plating. Its a cardinal sin in software engineering. NEVER gold plate. ALWAYS build to spec. In fact its a good reason to fire an engineer. Why? Because it does not deliver what was required, Wastes valuable time and resources Increases technical debt (this is actually a huge cost over the expected lifetime of the project!) Complicates testing Leads to scope creep His advice to me was simple: NEVER gold plate. I hope you take this pearl of wisdom in your career. It will help you advance and make you stand out. For personal hobbies this does not apply. But for a client (including us) if you fail to deliver the minimum spec then we cannot grant you an evaluation (by the way this post is not targetted specifically for you, it just felt like an appropriate place to explain this).

I have worked very hard on this project, and I am concerned that due to this error, my whole effort may be wasted.

    "answer": "Hi Abhay, This was a basic error. Unfortunately for basic errors we are not able to relax the requirements. All students were given a clear directive on what the minimum requirements were in order to be evaluated. Failure to follow those clear instructions prevents us from making any exceptions, because then we just have to dump all those requirements for all students and that would not be fair to those that took the care to be careful about their submissions.

Your docker image fails to run the required task because your Dockerfile is misconfigured. Did you follow the test environment setup mentioned in this post before posting your query? Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that import requests import pandas DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp( 2025-02-18 , tz= Asia/Kolkata ) url = f https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits try : response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60) fetch_commit = None if response.status_code == 200: commits = response.json() for commit in commits: sha = commit[ sha ] … Because if you did, you will realise why your evaluation failed.

    "question": "Hi, I work in the IT industry. There is no standard like “docker file has to be only in the root folder.” If at all you are setting a requirement why was this not mentioned in the project page? We were asked to build an app which solves the given tasks. You were OK for whatever code/tools/method to use as long as it works, there the “industry standard” didn’t show up ironically!!! Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. In the same industry that I work - we build the dockers and give it for prod push.",
    "answer": "You can take it up with .anand I did not come up with the standard. And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files. Only during evaluation, just because you had to build the image at your end because of some architectural issues, the “industry standard” comes in. Its not difficult to code to search for it, we are not idiots. It was one of the adjustments we considered and asked Anand if we could make the allowance. He made the decision to enforce this protocol. Kindest regards.",

    "answer": "Hi Hari, Your docker failed to build. Did you try to replicate the test environment as mentioned in Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that import requests import pandas DEADLINE = pd.Timestamp( 2025-02-18 , tz= Asia/Kolkata ) url = f https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits try : response = requests.get(url,headers=github_headers, timeout=60) fetch_commit = None if response.status_code == 200: commits = response.json() for commit in commits: sha = commit[ sha ] … If you tried you would find that it will not build. Thats why you have no logs. 90 such cases are there where the image could not be built from your repo. The specific error in your case is: tried copying requirements.txt which doesn’t exists Thats why there are no logs. Kind regards [Image OCR] ~)",

    "question": "Respected Sir, Thank you for your response and for providing the steps to replicate the test environment. Steps Taken to Replicate the Test Environment I cloned my repository using: bash git clone <my_repo_url> cd <my_repo_directory> I built the Docker image using: bash docker build -t. I ran the Docker container with: bash docker run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 I ensured that datagen.py and evaluate.py were placed in the same folder as instructed. Finally, I ran the evaluation script using: bash uvicorn evaluate.py --email=<any_email> --token_counter 1 --external_port 8000 Issue with Original Submission After reviewing the evaluation logs, I identified that the issue with my original submission was caused by binary incompatibility between pandas (version 2.0.3) and NumPy (version 1.24.3). These versions worked perfectly during development on my local machine and were tested multiple times across both Linux and Windows platforms before submission. Even after pulling the submitted Docker image from Docker Hub post-submission, it worked without any issues locally. However, during your evaluation, this incompatibility caused the container to fail. I acknowledge this issue, have fixed it in my updated submission, and previously conveyed this in my earlier message. Action Taken To address this issue, I made a small adjustment to my requirements.txt file to explicitly fix these versions for compatibility across all environments. This was the only change made to my submission. After rebuilding the container with this updated file, I tested it again thoroughly in your replicated test environment, and it worked as expected: The application initializes correctly on port 8000 within 5 minutes. It responds to requests within the required timeframe. I have pushed this updated image to Docker Hub under the same repository: Docker Hub URL: santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest Request for Re-Evaluation I kindly request that you pull the latest version of my Docker image from Docker Hub and re-run the evaluation process. I understand that deployability is being tested, and I have taken every necessary step to ensure that my submission now works in any environment, including replicating your test setup exactly. Previous Message for Reference For your convenience, here is my earlier message explaining this issue in detail: Greetings, Sir, I would like to bring to your notice a problem with my original submission of the Docker container. During evaluation, a binary incompatibility between pandas and numpy caused the container to fail. To my surprise, the same versions (pandas==2.0.3 and numpy==1.24.3) were working fine while developing on my local machine. I also tested it with the same Dockerfile on both Linux and Windows platforms using these versions, and it was functioning correctly before pushing and submitting it. I checked the other day after pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub following the submission, and it worked at that time as well. To resolve this issue, I adjusted the Dockerfile to explicitly fix these versions, rebuilt the container, and conducted further testing locally. The application now correctly initializes on port 8000 and returns expected responses within the required 5-minute timeframe. I’ve pushed the updated image to Docker Hub (santoshsharma003/tds-project-one-1:latest). Could you please ensure that the latest version of my image is pulled from Docker Hub before rerunning the evaluation? I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing my submission again. Thank you for your assistance!",

    "question": "What I observed is that most of the repositories appear to be copied from a single source. This original repository contains several issues, such as an incorrectly named Dockerfile and missing instructions to copy all necessary data. Unfortunately, many students seem to have uploaded it blindly without reviewing or fixing these problems.",
    "answer": "Most common reason for during running docker image was taskA module was missing which is because a lot of students blindly copied from someone with building and running image, if they would have done that they could have corrected it at early stage.",

Already the course has taken tolls on our mind. Please give partial marks for the correct run of the docker image or please evaluate my latest commit with the requirements.txt. Because of this project I will lose my cgpa and the hardwork that I have done till this term. A small mistake is causing me my full marks and grades. Atleast consider partial marking for the docker image which does the tasks. I have maintained 9+ cgpa in the diploma and I took other subjects which are easy this term like BDM still is really difficult to cope with the subject. Please consider something. atleast give 50% of the marks for each task which my image passes.",
    "answer": "Hi I understand your situation. We discussed all these scenarios in our weekly meets, and it was decided that we cannot make allowances for these because there was ample time to test your deployments and also ample sessions were conducted to address any difficulties you might have faced. A basic minimum standard was expected and we are unable to relax that threshold because then it would make evaluations meaningless. We are not just evaluating on your agent functions. We require deployability as a minimum target. If you solution was not deployable and functional then we cannot evaluate the functioning of your application. Once again I sympathise with what might seem minor errors. But they are not minor, even though it may only be a line that needs changing or a spelling mistake. They actually cause a critical failure. A minor mistake is a function not working that does not prevent other things from working. Critical failures prevents everything else from working and thus most of these what seems like minor failures are missclassified. They are in fact critical failures. I know its not of much comfort right now, but the learnings from this will be important going forward in your career. Kindest regards",

    "question": "Respected Sir , My roll number is 23f3001688 Pls check my repository properly because I have dockerfile in my repo but it is mentioned that it is not present. Here is my repository link and screenshot for your reference sir and the dockerfile is present sir github.com GitHub - Sharmilecholan/tds_project1 Contribute to Sharmilecholan/tds_project1 development by creating an account on GitHub. I think the mistake would have been because in my repo the file name is “dockerfile” and you have mentioned it as “Dockerfile” . So is it a mistake to put “D” in lowercase.

    "answer": "For dockerfile you have in repo, It was named differently, correct naming has to be Dockerfile. Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science You can take it up with .anand I did not come up with the standard. And it is a standard practise to have build configurations at root of a project otherwise no one will know where to search for the configuration files.

    "question": "Dear This is Senthur. I have reviewed the logs, and it indicates that the /app/app/main.py file is missing. However, in my project directory, the main.py file is located in the app/ folder, and the run.py file is in the root folder of the project, which is LLM_Automation_Agent . This structure allows the run.py file to run the project without any issues by calling the appropriate functions from app/main.py. To run the project, the command I used is: python run.py Since run.py is placed in the root folder and not in any subfolder, it should properly execute the project without any errors, as it redirects the calls to app/main.py. I believe the evaluation may have been incorrect because the project was not executed in the way it was intended. I kindly request you to re-run the project using the run.py script located in the root folder (llm-automation-agent). For your reference, I have attached screenshots from my local machine where the project was tested successfully, along with my GitHub screenshot. Here is the GitHub link to my project: github.com GitHub - ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent Contribute to ksenthurkumaran18052004/llm-automation-agent development by creating an account on GitHub.

I know in industry level it matters much but right now we are students and for us CGPA matters. i am also uploading his docker file image and mine with 0 commits after 18th feb.

    "question": "Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10. I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow. Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

    "question": "My code uses npx to format Markdown files using Prettier, specifically via subprocess.run([ npx , prettier.4.2 , --write , ...]), which assumes that npx is available in the environment. However, since the Docker container is based on Linux and I didn’t explicitly install Node.js or npx, this results in an error during evaluation. To test the functionality correctly, npx must be installed inside the running container. This can be fixed by entering the container and installing Node.js and npm using: bash: apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm Once installed, npx prettier.4.2 should work as expected. For reference, this approach worked perfectly when I tested the same task locally on my Windows 11 system, where npx is available by default.",

    "question": "Sir, in my docker logs, the datagen script encounters error during creating the credit card image for A8 during which it fails to find both the fonts used in the try and except blocks, resulting in the datagen script to stop abruptly without creating the files for A8 to A10. I actually want to know if this could have been avoided by some changes in my code or is it an issue in the datagen.py script, because as the situation currently stands, my app wasn’t even tested properly for tasks A8 to A10 as the datagen.py script failed to create the required files because it could not find a font which as far as I knew was not specified that it must be included in my own code or image somehow. Edit 1: I just realized that the datagen script looked for the fonts in python 3.13/site-packages/… But my docker image is using the python:3.12-slim-bookworm. Could that be an issue? There was nothing specified about required python version or required python image to be used in docker in the project 1 requirements. Edit 2: Even if the font not being available is somehow my fault, A9 and A10 still should not be penalized for A8 without proper checking. Though an error occured in A8, A9 and A10 still could have worked if each of these function calls were enclosed in their own try-except blocks, ensuring independent checks for each task. But the current datagen.py script fails as error propagates to main, where it is not handled and causes abnormal termination without executing the functions for creating files for A9 and A10 as well.

For now the fix is that we will not evaluate you on a8 and catch the datagen exception so as to not cause cascading failures. Thanks and kind regards.

    "answer": "Hi Hilal, You have to recreate the test environment as shown in this post Tds-official-Project1-discrepencies Tools in Data Science To replicate the test environment: Fetch the github repo’s latest commit before 18th feb use below code for that. You need to have github cli installed on your system and need authentication for certain github api enpoint access. Once authenticated and providing the appropriate repo details you can run this code using uv. # /// script # dependencies = [ # requests , # ] # /// import requests import datetime as dt import zoneinfo import argparse import os import zipfile parser = argparse.… That way you will be able to identify why the error was occuring. The specific error itself means: Docker is trying to run the command uv inside your container, but it can’t find the uv executable — it’s not installed or not in the system PATH inside the container. If you did not run evaluate.py as specified in our live sessions by recreating the test environment and then running evaluate.py then it would not have reflected how your dockerised application would work. Kind regards [Image OCR] ~)",

    "answer": "I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues. But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly. Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites. Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible. These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter. Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it. We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page. I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why. Kindest regards",

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.

    "answer": "One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected.

    "question": "With just 5 days left, I wanted to ask for a quick suggestion. I’m prioritizing PYQs for sure, but between revisiting lectures and attending TA sessions (both quite time-consuming), which one would you recommend focusing on for better returns? Also, if possible, could you please point out the top 2–3 most important topics—maybe things like LLM, Data Sourcing, etc.—to give more attention to?",
    "answer": "I recommend attending the Tues and Thurs session this week or watching the recordings. Its the same every term, those that attend the session score the best marks. I say this because there is no way for me to convey in a discourse post all the important things to focus on. But I can do that in a 2 hour session.",

    "question": "TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA. Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement. If you have passed it, its better to move on.",
    "answer": "Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective). So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.",

    "question": "To all the people who are posting in this thread, I kindly request you to get the correct facts and data before starting a new thread. So here are the first steps towards making this thread a more informed one: What is the policy related to bonus for Diploma level courses as per grading policy document? What is the policy adopted in previous instances of TDS? Did anyone read the text related to bonus marks associated with GA7? Does anyone know what should be done to get the bonus? Has anyone inquired about effort involved in getting the bonus? After answering all the above, has someone actually tried to follow instructions in the “mail” to get the bonus? Patiently waiting for all your responses.",
    "answer": "Hi everyone, A bit of data might be useful. Its been interesting reading all your posts, I thought I might share some brief insights. Firstly students vastly overestimate the ease of getting bonus marks in TDS. So of the approx 200 students that did GA7: The top bonus mark was 3. Only 2 students managed it. Going by that statistic, of the 600 students who are active in TDS, possibly 6 might have even managed to get 3 or more marks. So lets not pretend that this was easy by any stretch of the imagination. The mean bonus score was 1.27. So, on average, you would get less than a 1/3rd GAs worth of marks for the extra effort of an entire GA+extra work. The psychology study it revealed however is interesting on this thread to see. The difference between perception and reality. My advice is stop reacting emotionally and evaluate rationally. That is the data for you. Student Bonus600×371 7.62 KB Also noteworthy Bonus marks in TDS are never made known ahead of time for any term in the past and neither will it be in the future. None of us knew that there were going to be bonuses after the submission of GA7. Please stop requesting, “at least you should let us know before GA7”. How can we let you know, if we ourselves were not aware there were going to be bonus marks? Bonuses are always surprise opportunities that are not widely available to everyone. For example we never release them on the seek portal. In the past Anand has released them on discourse, where typically, in previous terms, less than a fraction of a third of the students are even engaged, let alone active. Of course students in the past complained saying, they did not know and were not informed. To which the response was, maybe you should be more actively engaged on discourse. How many people typically tried TDS bonus in the past? Probably around 50. So compared to previous terms, this term is a huge improvement! Bonuses are not a right. They are opportunities that become available for those that are engaged with the course. Where and when that opportunity becomes available varies. A bit like real life. However we have read all your concerns and we have decided to put a disclaimer in the grading document for future terms: Opportunities for bonus marks might become available for activities linked to any of the GAs, Projects or Course Modules. The may be revealed at anytime, on any platform (seek, discourse, course site) and through any medium (official email, discourse) at the discretion of the course team. Bonus marks are not guaranteed and are awarded at the discretion of the course team. [Image OCR] Student Bonus Students 50 40 30 20 10 36 Bonus Student Bonus Students 50 40 30 20 10 36 Bonus",

    "question": "Could you explain why so few students got good bonus marks? What was the criteria by which they were given?",
    "answer": "The rubric is challenging and requires some level of collaboration with others. Thats why the bonus marks are low. Also the there is minimum requirement for even being eligible for it, i.e. you must complete GA7 and give 3 peer reviews before you can even be considered for bonus eligibility.",
